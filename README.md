# PySRAG

This Python package provides tools for analyzing and processing data related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and other respiratory viruses. It includes functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training Gradient Boosting Models (GBMs) for binary or multiclass classification.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started with using the PySRAG package.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed
- Required Python packages (you can install them using `pip`):
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `joblib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `lightgbm`

### Installation

You can install the PySRAG package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install PySRAG
```

### Usage

Here's an example of how to use the SRAG package:

```python
import PySRAG

# Initialize the SRAG class
srag = PySRAG.SRAG(filename, path, path_utils)

# Generate training data
X, y = srag.generate_training_data(lag=0, objective='binary')

# Train a Gradient Boosting Model
trainer = srag_analysis.GBMTrainer(objective='binary')
model = trainer.fit(X, y)
```

For more detailed information and examples, please refer to the package documentation.
